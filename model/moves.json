While a substitute in play, the user may carry as if it were riding the user, and it takes all damage that would go to the user, and any negative status effects that aren’t self-inflicted. If the substitute takes more damage than would be required to break it, the damage does not roll over onto the user. 


You may instead have the substitute wander off on its own, using all of the user’s stats, moves, and so on but taking damage separately.

/*Description:
**This json file is used to store pokemon move information
**
**Details:
**The header is the name of the move
**Name is the given name of the move.
**Power is a number the program can do calculations based on. 
**Style will be one of 4 values: melee, ranged, self, or weather 
**Flavor is flavor text, that explains what the move looks like. 
**Effect is what the move actually does, mechanically. 
**Crit is what happens when the move crits. A number of moves do not crit.
**
**The program will print out a cost for the move equal to $50 times its power or its power squared or someting like that. 
**The program will also make it worth 0-4 dice depending on power for rolling for roleplaying purposes.
**A move grants dice for use equal to power/30 rounded to the nearest whole. 
**A move with 50, 60, or 70 power grants 2 dice. So if you want to use 20 power scratch, it only grants 1 die.
**Moves with 10 power grant no dice. Splash and struggle, nearly useless moves, are like this.
**Moves typically have no more than 100 power, but there are one or two with 120 power.

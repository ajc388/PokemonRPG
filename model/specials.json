But as far as game rules are concerned, they are treated as separate Pokémon, with the exception that when the Pokémon is recalled its minions return with it and when it is sent out the minions appear on spaces adjacent to it. The minions are both the lowest Pokémon on the evolutionary line, having the first two moves on their sheet available and 1 in all their EV’s. These Pokémon never increase their stats or learn new moves. On the Pokémon’s turn, it can either dash and take a standard action or have both of its minions dash and take a standard action. The minions have no FP available to them; instead they share the main Pokémon’s FP. Any compulsion that affects any of the Pokémon affects them all, once again because of the hive mind. Only the main Pokémon rolls mind saves."

	"Minions":

		"Description": "The Pokemon has a pair of offspring that it shares a hive-mind relationship with. As far as being stored in a Pokeball and league rules are concerned, you all count as one Pokémon, like Exeggcute. But as far as game rules are concerned, they are treated as separate Pokémon, with the exception that when the Pokémon is recalled its minions return with it and when it is sent out the minions appear on spaces adjacent to it. The minions are both the lowest Pokémon on the evolutionary line, having the first two moves on their sheet available and 1 in all their EV’s. These Pokémon never increase their stats or learn new moves. On the Pokémon’s turn, it can either dash and take a standard action or have both of its minions dash and take a standard action. The minions have no FP available to them; instead they share the main Pokémon’s FP. Any compulsion that affects any of the Pokémon affects them all, once again because of the hive mind. Only the main Pokémon rolls mind saves."

	"Gargantuan":
	{
		"Description": "The massive Pokemon has double HP. It cannot dodge any attacks from regularly-sized Pokemon or crit against them. If a gargantuan Pokémon is identified, attacks made against it crit automatically. One hit-KO moves do 300 damage to gargantuan Pokémon instead of automatically KOing. Gargantuan Pokémon do not respect puny trainers easily. They roll 2d6, and if the result is higher than the trainer’s level, they disobey, often attacking an ally. This applies any time the trainer wants the Pokémon to do anything. Gargantuan Pokémon take up 4 or more battlefield spaces. No gargantuan Pokémon may pass through a space occupied by another such Pokémon, and if a gargantuan Pokémon moves into a space occupied by a regularly-sized Pokémon that Pokémon must make a speed save. It is moved to a space adjacent to the gargantuan Pokémon of its choice, but if if fails the speed save it takes damage equal to the gargantuan Pokémon’s strength. Once it passess that speed save, it automatically can repeat this for the rest of the turn, automatically moving out of the way of the gargantuan Pokémon’s way. When calculating range, that range goes out from every space the Pokémon occupies to make the largest range possible."
